# Notes 1: Cloud Concepts Overview

In the section below, please add your notes starting with the section prompt.

## 1, Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.

Data Overload is the age old problem of we collected this data now how do you turn it into information. The solution is by using software and human data analytsis to process the data into information.

  **Data Overload**: Businesses need to process huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of processing power, sophisticated software and human analytical skills.
  
Since the Covid Pandemic of 2000 companies have had to start supporting offsite working options accross the vast majority of occupations and  workers across the world have proven that work out put does not fall using these options 
  
  **Mobile and Wireless Usages**: More employers are offering remote work options that require smartphones, tablets and laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming ability.
  
To cut cost by reducing captial expandature and using "as a service" options the cloud services have expanded the amount of people that can start IT operations. It also has the abilty to grow and shrink as required to meet the needs of the client.

  **Cloud Services**: Many businesses no longer operate their own “server farms” to store massive amounts of data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain that data.
  
Video is still a data hog but with improvments to data encoding and increases in data speeds of everyone Video usage is a very popular option for meetings especially in a Work from home enviornment.
  
  **Bandwidth for Video**: Videoconferencing solutions have become more and more popular, so more network bandwidth is needed to support them sufficiently.
  
 
  **The Four Pillars of an IT Framework**: The four pathways of IT. You have the people that develop and support your IT Infrustruture. Physical Servers, Switches, Patchpanels and basic network support. Developers or development find drivers of tech. Issues that can be solved in tech and problems that need to be solved to improve tech. Security professionals look at what the other three pillers do and cover issues that could cause harm or theft. And the Data pillers look at what data you need or have.
  
  ## 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
  
    **From the large IT department inside a major enterprise to the pieces that form technical operations for a smaller firm, four areas consistently appear as the primary ingredients necessary to build a functioning business system.**
    
            I initially felt that this could not be tru but as i looked at the places I have worked and I could identify all four pillers in every size business. lets look at a small busness. When you buy cell phones for your employees you are doing infrusture, when you are looking for data solutions like vehicle tracking software you are doing development, Security is when you enforce a policy of setting pins on company cell phones. Backing up your Quicken Quick books to a flash drive is monitoring your data.
            
    **“IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a Chief Information Security Officer and technology blogger.**
    
            We just had a discussion about this in class with the example of Borders and Barnes & Noble. But to look at another one look at MySpace and how it was practically first the social media work space but Facebook came along with the technology and frmat to engage users in closer to real time.
            
   ## 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?         
   
            Learning about the four pillers was a concept that I did not know about til this class and it reall defines all the types of IT in the workplace
            
  ## 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
  
            I am looking forward to learning more about cloud based service and how it is replacing many traditional IT roles at work sites.
